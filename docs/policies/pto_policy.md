# Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy

## Eligibility
All employees are eligible for Paid Time Off (PTO) after completing 30 days of continuous employment with the company. Both full-time and part-time employees working at least 20 hours per week are eligible for PTO.

## Accrual
Employees accrue PTO based on their length of service:
- 0-2 years of employment: 15 days (120 hours) per year
- 2-5 years of employment: 20 days (160 hours) per year
- 5+ years of employment: 25 days (200 hours) per year

PTO is accrued on a monthly basis, and the total accrual is capped at 1.5 times the annual PTO allotment.

## Pay
PTO is paid at 100% of the employee's regular base salary.

## Requesting PTO
Employees must submit PTO requests at least 2 weeks in advance to their manager through the HR portal or by contacting HR directly. PTO requests will be approved based on business needs and availability of coverage.

## Usage
PTO can be used for vacation, personal time, or any other time off that is not related to illness. If the employee is absent due to illness, they should use sick leave instead of PTO.
