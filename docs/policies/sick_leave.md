# Sick Leave Policy

## Eligibility
All employees are eligible for sick leave from the first day of employment. Both full-time and part-time employees working at least 20 hours per week are entitled to sick leave benefits.

## Duration
Employees are entitled to 10 days (or 80 hours) of paid sick leave per calendar year. Unused sick leave does not roll over to the next year, and there is no carryover for future use.

## Pay
Sick leave is paid at 100% of the employee's regular base salary.

## Requesting Sick Leave
Employees should notify their manager and HR as soon as possible if they are unable to report to work due to illness. If the absence is expected to last longer than 3 days, a doctor's note may be required. Sick leave may be taken intermittently or in full days as needed.

## Usage
Sick leave can be used for the employee's own illness, injury, or medical appointments, or to care for a dependent family member who is ill or injured.
